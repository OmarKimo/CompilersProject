# Compilers Project
## Project Overview:
Simple C language Compiler that is designed to compile basic
functions of C language components.
### Tools and Technologies used:
* Flex: compile lex files
* Bison: compile yacc files
* Cygwin: generate executable files
### Production rules:
* Variables and Constants declaration
* Mathematical expressions (+, -, *, /)
* Assignment statement
* Block structure ({}, ())
### Quadruples:
* MOV 3, R0 [move value 3 to register R0]
* MOV R0, x [move value in register R0 to variable x]
* ADD R0, R1, R2 [add the value in R0 & R1 and move it to R2]
* SUB R0, R1, R2 [the same as ADD but subtract]
* MUL R0, R1, R2 [the same as ADD but multiply]
* DIV R0, R1, R2 [the same as ADD but divide]
